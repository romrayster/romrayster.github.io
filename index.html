            </p>
            
            <h2 class="mt-4">Key Features:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accurate Location-based UV Index:</strong>Sunny SunAdvisor uses your device's GPS functionality to fetch your current location. It then retrieves real-time UV Index data based on your location and the current date and time. This ensures that you receive precise information about the sun's intensity in your area.</li>
                <li><strong>Smart Sun Exposure Timer:</strong> Once you start your outdoor activity, Sunny SunAdvisor initiates a timer based on your maximum safe exposure time. You'll receive a notification when you reach 66% of your allotted time, reminding you to take appropriate sun protection measures. When the full exposure time elapses, Sunny SunAdvisorwill alert you to seek shade or reapply sunscreen.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Maximum Exposure Time:</strong> By taking into account your skin type and whether you wear sunscreen, Sunny SunAdvisor calculates a personalized maximum safe exposure time. It considers factors such as sunburn risk, SPF (Sun Protection Factor) of the sunscreen, and the adjustable reflective surface setting to provide you with customized recommendations.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustable Skin Type and SPF:</strong>Sunny SunAdvisor allows you to set your specific skin type and adjust the SPF of the sunscreen you're using. Whether you have fair or dark skin, you can fine-tune the app's recommendations to align with your skin's sensitivity and susceptibility to sun damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflective Surface Setting:</strong> Sunny SunAdvisor understands that the intensity of UV radiation can vary based on your surroundings. It includes a reflective surface setting that helps you account for surfaces like water, sand, or snow, which can amplify the sun's effects. By enabling this setting, you ensure that your exposure time is adjusted accordingly for a more accurate assessment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Sunny SunAdvisor is your proactive partner in maintaining healthy sun habits. By providing valuable information and reminders, it empowers you to enjoy the sun responsibly, reduce the risk of sunburn and skin damage, and promote long-term skin health.
